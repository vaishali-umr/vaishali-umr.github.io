## Let's Connect

I consider myself a data detective. Nothing excites me more than analyzing a data crime scene and drawing meaningful conclusions to "find the culprits" and solve problems! Right now, Iâ€™m using data-driven recruitment software at Appcast to help employers hire better.

I live in the Chicago suburbs. Hit me up if you want to grab coffee or a drink.

You can also reach me at vumrikar@yahoo.com or message me on LinkedIn.
