# Welcome to my Data Science portfolio!

I consider myself a data detective.

Nothing excites me more than analyzing a data crime scene and drawing meaningful conclusions to "find the culprits" and solve problems! Currently, Iâ€™m using data-driven recruitment software at Appcast to help employers hire better.

Here you can explore samples of my data analytics work.
